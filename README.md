rxel.rb
=======

Ruby port of the [rx.el](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/emacs/emacs-59/emacs/lisp/emacs-lisp/rx.el) literate regular expression library.

There are already a couple of "readable regular expressions"
libraries around.  This one is better.  Plus I needed the Ruby metaprogramming/DSL-implementation practice.
